# Social Media Feed Backend - Project Nexus

Welcome to the Social Media Feed Backend, a case study project within the [alx-project-nexus](https://github.com/alx-project-nexus) repository, developed as part of the ProDev Backend Engineering program. This repository documents my work on building a scalable backend for a social media feed, showcasing my understanding of GraphQL API development, real-time interactions, and scalable database design. It serves as a knowledge hub and fosters collaboration with frontend and backend learners.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Build a backend to manage posts and user interactions for a social media feed.
- Implement GraphQL APIs for flexible and efficient data querying.
- Optimize database schemas for high-traffic, scalable applications.
- Serve as a reference for backend engineering concepts and best practices.
- Facilitate collaboration with frontend learners for seamless project integration.

## Overview of Social Media Feed Backend

The Social Media Feed Backend prepares engineers for developing scalable, interactive systems like social media platforms. Through hands-on development, I’ve built a backend that supports post management, user interactions (likes, comments, shares), and real-time updates using GraphQL, Django, and PostgreSQL. This project emphasizes efficient schema design and flexible querying to handle high-volume traffic.


## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered
- **Django**: Primary framework for backend development and API creation.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used for efficient storage and querying of relational data (posts, comments, interactions).
- **GraphQL (Graphene)**: Implemented for flexible, client-driven data querying.
- **GraphQL Playground**: Provided as an intuitive interface for API testing and documentation.

### Important Backend Development Concepts
- **Database Design**: Modeled relationships between `Post`, `Comment`, `Interaction`, and `User` entities in PostgreSQL, with indexes for query optimization.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Leveraged GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates of user interactions.
- **Caching Strategies**: Applied caching to reduce database load for frequently accessed data, such as trending posts.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented
- **Challenge**: Handling high query loads for large datasets in a social media feed.  
  **Solution**: Implemented indexing and query batching in PostgreSQL to optimize performance.  
- **Challenge**: Enabling real-time updates for user interactions (e.g., likes, comments).  
  **Solution**: Integrated GraphQL subscriptions to push real-time updates to clients.  
- **Challenge**: Ensuring API usability for frontend developers.  
  **Solution**: Published a hosted GraphQL Playground with clear documentation and example queries.

### Best Practices and Personal Takeaways
**Best Practices**:
- Followed DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) by modularizing GraphQL resolvers and database logic in reusable functions.
- Implemented logging (e.g., `logging.info`) for debugging and monitoring API performance.
- Used GraphQL Playground to provide interactive, well-documented API endpoints.

**Takeaways**:
- GraphQL’s ability to let clients specify data needs simplifies frontend-backend integration.
- Efficient database schema design is critical for scalability in high-traffic applications.
- Collaboration with frontend teams ensures APIs align with UI requirements.

## Case Study: Social Media Feed Backend

### Overview
The Social Media Feed Backend powers a platform for managing posts and user interactions. It uses GraphQL for flexible querying, PostgreSQL for scalable data storage, and Django for robust backend logic, preparing engineers for real-world social media platform development.

### Project Goals
- **Post Management**: Design APIs for creating, fetching, and managing posts.
- **Flexible Querying**: Implement GraphQL for advanced, client-driven querying capabilities.
- **Scalability**: Optimize database schema for high-volume user interactions.

### Key Features
- **GraphQL APIs**: Enable flexible querying of posts, comments, and interactions with resolvers for creation and management.
- **Interaction Management**: Support user actions like liking, commenting, and sharing posts, with analytics tracking for feedback.
- **API Testing**: Provide a hosted GraphQL Playground for intuitive API testing.
- **Scalable Design**: Optimize database queries and schema for high-traffic applications.
